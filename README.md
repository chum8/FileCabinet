# FileCabinet

Code for a feature rich database application that replaces a paper File Cabinet system for tax records, receipts, etc.

# Instructions to execute

    1. Create a directory C:\Program Files\FileCabinet
    2. Download the following files to C:\Program Files\FileCabinet
         /bin/Debug/FileCabinet.exe
         /bin/Debug/SQLFileCabinetDB.mdf
         /bin/Debug/SQLFileCabinetDB_log.ldf
    3. Run FileCabinet.exe

# Troubleshooting

If the database doesn't load right away, try again.  Sometimes the server takes time to spin up.

By default, the program will attempt to locate the database file at C:\Program Files\FileCabinet.  Be sure the database file is in this directory.  Alternatively, you can specify a different directory in the program.
